## Governance and Voting

### 1. Is there a treasury?

* Yes. A treasury was formed to fund anything that adds value to the protocol, taking up to 10% of WAV emissions.

### 2. What is the main goal of the treasury?

* Beyond commissioning works for the Collective, the treasury funds will be used to add value/improve the project \(marketing/pr/administration/management/audits/etc\) 

### 3. Who controls the treasury?

* The treasury is controlled via governance.

### 4. Who can vote?

* WAV held in the TGW Governance Vault will form governance tokens. Voting weight is measured in TGW.

### 5. Why TGW and not WAV as the governance token

* TGW being the vaulted WAV LP, commits long term holder to be able to vote on proposal/issues, while benefiting from the protocol's earning. Given the longer term staking nature of TGW, it helps prevent short term vote manipulations as well.

### 6. Which governance platform is used for voting?

* We will be using the well-established gasless [governance client](https://snapshot.page) by Snapshot Labs.
