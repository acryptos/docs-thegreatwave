## How do I stake my WAV and participate in the DAO?

### 1. How to form WVP LP
* [ACSI.finance (HOW TO video tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe5DyLA1p0I) by [CryptoBKT](https://t.me/cryptoBKT)

### 2. Can I form WVP LP from WAV?
* Yes. You may use WAV to form WVP without the other tokens. This method is easier but sub-optimal, means you may get less WVP by doing so.

### 3. Why would anyone want to buy WVP?
* You will need WVP to stake in order to get the governance token.

### 4. How to vault WVP as a governance token
* Guide available soon

### 5. It's too complicated! Is there an easier way?
* We will be launching the Governance NFT, where TGW governance token will be imbued within, allowing one to own the NFT to be part of the DAO.


## Governance and Voting

### 1. Is there a treasury?

* Yes. A treasury was formed to fund anything that adds value to the protocol, taking up to 10% of WAV emissions.

### 2. What is the main goal of the treasury?

* Beyond commissioning works for the Collective, the treasury funds will be used to add value/improve the project \(marketing/pr/administration/management/audits/etc\) 

### 3. Who controls the treasury?

* The treasury is controlled via governance, and needs to be signed off by the Core DAO.

### 4. Who can vote?

* WAV held in the TGW Governance Vault will form governance tokens. Voting weight is measured in TGW.

### 5. Why TGW and not WAV as the governance token

* TGW being the vaulted WAV LP, commits long term holder to be able to vote on proposal/issues, while benefiting from the protocol's earning. Given the longer term staking nature of TGW, it helps prevent short term vote manipulations as well.

### 6. Which governance platform is used for voting?

* We will be using the well-established gasless [governance client](https://vote.thegreatwave.io/#/) by Snapshot Labs.
