There is no one-size-fits-all approach for how artists want to manage their career.

Being in a collective offers flexibility and autonomy, as opposed to being tied down by record deals bloated with opportunity cost. Instead of owing the label, you own part of the collective. 

The DAO funds your work, provides industry and developer support, exposes your art to new audiences and communities within the Web3 space, and shares the profits with you. 

We are currently open for artist submissions.
