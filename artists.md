**Be Like Water**

There is no one-size-fits-all approach for how artists want to manage their career.

Being in a collective offers flexibility and autonomy, as opposed to being tied down by exclusive deals bloated with opportunity cost. 

We value indepedence and collaboration. Instead of owing the label, you own part of the collective.

The DAO funds your work, provides industry and developer support, exposes your art to new audiences and communities within the Web3 space, and shares the profits with you. 

The Web3/NFT space can be overwhelming. We want to cut through the noise and help artists navigate this space, by building more opportunities for interactive, two-way artist/fan relationships that incentivises long-term fan rewards. 

We are currently open for artist submissions.
