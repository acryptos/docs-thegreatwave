# The Great Wave

<mark style="color:red;">**DO NOT APE IN. DYOR. Emissions have NOT started.**</mark>

## An Artist Collective DAO

By artists, for artists.

**ArtTech. Art x Crypto.**

### The Great Wave

To create an ecosystem for artists, music/art lovers, developers and investors that grows sustainably, provides and promotes quality work, community, and collaboration.

We believe in the inevitable future of blockchain/web 3.0/NFTs/decentralisation, and we want to help position artists to ride this great wave over the rising tide.

### First Wave

* Core DAO vote on treasury to commission work and hire staff/project managers for marketing campaigns to drive hype + social media/discord management + partnership with marketplaces

* Front-facing artist lineup to market and promote movement, legitimise use case to encourage mainstream adoption

* Designers/Consultants/Developers to support and help onboard & gamify assets into NFTs

* Revenue generated to be reinvested in treasury and/or distributed to TGW holders

* Leadership is paramount especially in the beginning phases, but we must encourage and elevate community contributorsâ€™ creativity and contribution in order to progressively move towards decentralisation - allow for more autonomous projects to be developed and approved

* Our larger goal aims towards becoming a multi-disciplined network of artists, designers and developers, with specific sub-labels to curate various genres
