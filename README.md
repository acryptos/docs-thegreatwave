# The Great Wave

<mark style="color:red;">**DO NOT APE IN. DYOR. Emissions have NOT started.**</mark>

## An Artist Collective DAO

To create an ecosystem for artists and their patrons, music/art lovers, developers and investors that grows sustainably, provides and promotes quality work, community, and collaboration.

We believe that the advent of decentralised finance and the composability that blockchain technology brings will empower individuals and communities with more opportunities, resources, agency and sense of ownership. 

As the world sits on the cusp of a new technological renaissance and creator economy, we want to help position artists ride the great wave over this rising tide through our combined efforts.  

### First Wave

* Core DAO vote on treasury to commission work

* Front-facing artist lineup to promote movement

* Designers/Consultants/Developers to support and help onboard & gamify digital collectibles

* Hire staff/project managers for marketing campaigns + social media/discord management + partnerships with marketplaces and applications

* Revenue generated to be reinvested in treasury and distributed to TGW holders

* While the beginning phases of any DAO is founder-led and driven, we must encourage and elevate community contributorsâ€™ creativity and contribution in order to progressively move towards decentralisation and allow for more autonomous projects to be developed and approved
