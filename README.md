# The Great Wave

We are building a new plaform for artists, fans, developers and investors that focuses on sustainability, providing and promoting quality work, community, and collaboration.

As the world sits on the cusp of a new technological renaissance and creator/investor economy known as Web3, we want to help position artists ride the great wave over this rising tide.

As an ecosystem, The Great Wave aims to set a new precedent based on the following approach:

* DeFi and DAO model allows fans and investors to fund and directly support artists and get return on their investment

* Artists to be paid through commission of their work for the DAO, and can choose to reinvest in the WAV ecosystem 

* Developers, designers and project team help to create and gamify assets for artists, creating more revenue streams while tapping into new audiences and communities

* Grow and nurture The Great Wave as a community where artists can network and collaborate with each other, while positioning ourselves as a brand to partner with various projects and marketplaces

* Revenue generated to be reinvested in treasury and shared with artists and DAO token holders
