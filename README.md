# The Great Wave

<mark style="color:red;">**DO NOT APE IN. DYOR. Emissions have NOT started.**</mark>

## An Artist Collective DAO

We are building a new ecosystem for artists, fans, developers and investors that focuses on sustainability, providing and promoting quality work, community, and collaboration.

As the world sits on the cusp of a new technological renaissance and creator/investor economy known as Web3, we want to help position artists ride the great wave over this rising tide.


### First Wave

* Core DAO vote on treasury to commission work

* Front-facing artist lineup to promote movement

* Designers/Consultants/Developers to support and help onboard & gamify digital collectibles

* Hire staff/project managers for marketing campaigns + social media/discord management + partnerships with marketplaces and applications

* Revenue generated to be reinvested in treasury and distributed to TGW holders

* While the beginning phases of any DAO is founder-led and driven, we must encourage and elevate community contributorsâ€™ creativity and contribution in order to progressively move towards decentralisation and allow for more autonomous projects to be developed and approved
