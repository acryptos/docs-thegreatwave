## An Artist Collective DAO

By artists, for artists.

ArtTech. Art x Crypto.

### The Great Wave

To create an ecosystem for artists, music/art lovers, developers and investors that grows sustainably, provides and promotes quality work, community, and collaboration.

We believe in the inevitable future of blockchain/web 3.0/NFTs/decentralisation, and we want to help position artists to ride this great wave over the rising tide.

### First Wave

Core DAO vote on treasury to commission work and hire staff/project managers for marketing campaigns to drive hype + social media/discord management + partnership with marketplaces

Front-facing artist lineup to market and promote movement, legitimise use case to encourage mainstream adoption

Designers/Consultants/Developers to support and help onboard & gamify assets into NFTs

Revenue generated to be reinvested in treasury and/or distributed to TGW holders

Leadership is paramount especially in the beginning phases, but we must encourage and elevate community contributors’ creativity and contribution in order to progressively move towards decentralisation - allow for more autonomous projects to be developed and approved

Our larger goal aims towards becoming a multi-disciplined network of artists, designers and developers, with specific sub-labels to curate various genres

## Tokenomics

WAV is our Native Token, on Binance Smart Chain. WVP (WAV Pool) is our Core LP, consisting of WAV-ACS-BNB in 6:2:2 ratio. It is a Balancer V2 LP, on the Acsi.Finance deployment, on Binance Smart Chain. TGW is our Governance Vault, consisting of staked WVP. It governs the DAO, and also earns DAO revenue and emissions, which will be automatically compounded in the Vault. Withdrawing from the Governance Vault incurs a withdrawal fee, which is shared among the remaining TGW holders.

TGW withdrawal fee is set at 90% for the first 6 months after launch, reducing to 15% in months 6-12. **This is in effect a lockup for TGW holders for the first 6 months of the project with a punitive 90% withdrawal fee.**

### Emissions

3000 WAV per day will be emitted, reducing by 16.88% every 88 days to give a maximum supply of 1,863,981 WAV.

Emissions distribution:

60% to TGW

10% to Treasury

30% to Farms

Initial Farm allocations (TBC):

WVP 5X

WAV-BNB PancakeSwap LP 1X

A2B2 1X

### Genesis

300,000 WAV were minted, and pooled with $200,000 of liquidity provided by the Founding Team, giving WAV an initial value of $1, creating $500,000 of WVP. $200,000 WVP was staked into TGW and given to the Founding Team. $270,000 WVP was staked into TGW and given to the Treasury. $30,000 WVP was given to the Treasury. **Effectively 94% of WAV and WVP was locked into TGW which has a 90% withdrawal fee for the first 6 months of the project, reducing to 15% in months 6-12.**

### Farm Boost

[Similar to ACryptoS](https://docs.acryptos.com/acryptos-farms#farm-rewards-boost), TGW holders can boost their Farm returns by up to 2.5 times. Unlike in ACryptoS, TGW is transferable, and Farm boost will be calculated using a time-weighted average of users’ TGW holdings, including TGW staked in NFTs.

The amount of boost is determined using the same formula as in ACryptoS:

1.5 \* \[% user's share of Governance Vault] \* \[TVL in Farm]&#x20;

(up to a maximum of 2.5X of users’ holdings in Farm)

### NFTs

TGW NFTs will be able to have TGW staked inside each NFT, which can be unstaked by burning the NFT, setting a base value for each NFT. TGW staked in users’ NFTs boost their Farm returns by up to 2.5 times.

### Governance

TGW holders govern the DAO, and control the treasury. An elected Core DAO administers the Treasury and controls its multi-sig, this will initially consist of Charlie Lim, X, and HM.&#x20;

### Comments

There are some novel ideas in the Tokenomics here. Liquidity is built into the Governance Vault, so there is no longer a need to separately incentivise liquidity. It also means Governance Vault holders are expected to take on IL risk. The TGW withdrawal fee acts as a lock-in for the Founding Team and early investors. NFTs play a central role in the project’s Tokenomics.

### Founding Team

The founding team consists of musician Charlie Lim, developer X of ACryptoS, and several veterans from the art and crypto worlds.
