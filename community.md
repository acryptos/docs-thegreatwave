**Why art DAO?**

Investing in The Great Wave is to back and be part of a collective DAO that is artist-driven and led in a new creator/investor economy.

Creating a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) allows us to be nimble and adapt accordingly to the times (insert “be like water” Bruce Lee quote), while the appeal of a collective allows us to build strength in numbers and have more influence over the various industries we are in.

The format of the DAO is inherently open, inclusive, and accountable, sharing value with the participants who create it. 

While the beginning phases of any DAO is founder-led and driven, we must encourage and elevate contributors’ creativity and contribution in order to progressively move towards decentralisation and allow for more projects to be developed and approved autonomously. 

We believe that this structure is key to building a flatter, egalitarian model to help support artists thrive in this industry.
