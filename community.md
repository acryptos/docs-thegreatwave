**Investing in The Great Wave is to back and be part of a collective DAO that is artist-driven and led in a new creator/investor economy.**

The DAO has a share in the music/art created, and WAV token holders (in its governance token form TGW) form the DAO, hence getting a share in any upside of released works/assets/ticketed events. 

The format of the DAO is inherently open and accountable, sharing value with the participants who create it. 

While the beginning phases of any DAO is founder-led and driven, we must encourage and elevate community contributorsâ€™ creativity and contribution in order to progressively move towards decentralisation and allow for more projects to be developed and approved autonomously. We believe that this structure is key to building a flatter, egalitarian model for the music industry.
