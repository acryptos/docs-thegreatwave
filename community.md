Investing in The Great Wave is to back and be part of a collective that is artist-driven and led in a new creator/investor economy. 

We took a community-first, ground-up approach that allows anyone to be a stakeholder as soon as the token is formed, with staking mechanisms that incentivise long-term holders.

The DAO has a share in the music/art created, and WAV token holders (in its governance token form TGW) form the DAO, hence getting a share in any upside of released works/assets/ticketed events. 

The format of the DAO is inherently open and accountable, sharing value with the participants who create it. We believe that this structure is key to building a more egalitarian model for the music industry.
